  description: |
    Brings functional programming to Python land by providing a bunch of
     primitives to write declarative business logic. Also enforces better
     architecture with fully typed with annotations and checked with mypy.
     This package is PEP561 compatible and adds emulated Higher Kinded Types
     support. It also provides type-safe interfaces to create your own data-types
     with enforced laws, and has a bunch of helpers for better composition.
